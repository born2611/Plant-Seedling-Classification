#Plant-Seedling-Classification

This competition give me a training set and a test set of images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the competition is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo.
So I used CNN(Convolutional neural network) Transfer learning from VGG16 to reach the goal.
